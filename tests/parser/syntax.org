This file is used to demonstrate org syntax support in org-mode.



* Inline contents
Mlorg handles a lot of inline contents: /emphasis/, *bold*,
/nested *inline*/ contents that org does not support. [[file:links][Links]], =inline
verbatim= or ~inline~. =inline verbatim *do not nest*=.

You also have footnote reference: 
- Named: [fn:name:] refers to the footnote =name= (See [[Footnote
  definition for how to define footnotes]])
- Anonymous [fn::Contents of my footnote right here]: creates a
  footnote without a name.

Babel syntax is handled although there is no support yet:
call_program[conf1, conf2](arg1=value,arg2=value)[conf3, conf4]

You can use inline source code with src: src_ocaml{let x = 3} and
src_ocaml[options]{let x = 3}. You have also latex fragment $\mathscr
L = \mathbb N \oplus \mathscr P(X)$. You can insert a break line with
=\\= at the end of a line \\
You can use inline links of the form protocol://foobar
(eg. http://foobar).

There is also macros {{{MACRO(ARG)}}}

You can create anchor in your document <<<ANCHOR>>> and <<RADIO TARGET
LINKS>>. You also have expnonents and subscripts: t_{1}^{1}.

** Timestamps
There's plenty of way to insert timestamps in your source:

- <2013-05-18 sam.> : plain timestamps. Used to indicate that an event
  is happening at a date.
- <2013-05-18 sam.>--<2013-05-18 sam.>: timestamp ranges (same thing
  as above but for events spanning over several days)
- SCHEDULED: <2013-05-18 sam.>: to indicate that this task is scheduled to be done on the given date
- DEADLINE: <2013-05-18 sam.>: indicates a deadline for the given date
- Inactive timestamps: [2013-05-18 sam.] (don't show up in the agenda)

Of course those timestamp comes with time as well: <2013-05-18 sam. 10:00>.

At last, you can have satistics cookie: [3/2] and [100%]. Org-mode
updates them, =mlorg= doesn't.
* Blocks
** Headings
*** TODO Level 3
*** DONE Level 4                                                :tag1:tag2:
** Math

You can use

$$ formula $$

or

\begin{environment}PARAM
LaTeX code
\end{environment}

** Code and verbatim
To enter verbatim code you can use

: Code
: Code

or

#+begin_example
Code
Code
#+end_example

To typeset code belonging to a specific language, you can use:

#+BEGIN_SRC ocaml
let x = 3
#+END_SRC

** Quotes

Entered via

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Some quote.
#+END_QUOTE
** Horizontal rules.
Just use

--------
** Drawers
You can use drawers to store information about a heading:

:DRAWER:
Drawer content
:END:

There is at the moment one special kind of drawers, properties drawers:

:PROPERTIES:
:KEY: Value
:END:
They directly get stored inside the headings for easier use by
plugins.
** Lists
Most of org's list are supported.

Regular lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- [ ] Checkbox
- [X] Checked checkbox

Numbered lists:

1. Item one
2. Item two
3. [@i] Item three (rendered as (iii))
** Keywords and directives
Org's keywords and directives are handled.

#+DIRECTIVE: VALUE

Special directive defined as keyword in org-mode are handled.

#+NAME: foo
A block named =foo=.
