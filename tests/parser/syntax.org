This file is used to demonstrate org syntax support in org-mode.



* Inline contents
Mlorg handles a lot of inline contents: /emphasis/, *bold*,
/nested *inline*/ contents that org does not support. [[file:links][Links]], =inline
verbatim=. =inline verbatim *do not nest*=.

You also have footnote reference: 
- Named: [fn:name:] refers to the footnote =name= (See [[Footnote
  definition for how to define footnotes]])
- Anonymous [fn::Contents of my footnote right here]: creates a
  footnote without a name.

Babel syntax is handled although there is no support yet:
call_program[conf1, conf2](arg1=value,arg2=value)[conf3, conf4]

You can use inline source code with src: src_ocaml{let x = 3} and
src_ocaml[options]{let x = 3}. You have also latex fragment $\mathscr
L = \mathbb N \oplus \mathscr P(X)$. You can insert a break line with
=\\= at the end of a line \\
You can use inline links of the form protocol://foobar
(eg. http://foobar).

There is also macros {{{MACRO(ARG)}}}
